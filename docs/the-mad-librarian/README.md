in a dark and foggy alleyway in Victorian London, a group of friends found themselves trapped in a lift with a mad librarian named Ebenezer Scrooge. The friends had been visiting the library on a cold and dreary night, and they had been using the lift to reach the upper floors when it suddenly stopped working.

Scrooge, who was also riding in the lift, became increasingly agitated as the minutes ticked by. He began to pace back and forth and rant and rave, feeling like he was going to lose his mind if he didn't get out of the lift soon. The friends were terrified of the mad librarian, and they huddled together in the corner of the lift, praying for their lives.

After what felt like an eternity, the lift finally started moving again, and the friends were able to escape. However, the experience had left them shaken and scared, and they vowed never to return to the library again. As for Scrooge, he remained trapped in his madness, and he continued to haunt the corridors of the library, muttering to himself and ranting about the miseries of life.
